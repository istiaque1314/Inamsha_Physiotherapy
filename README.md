I recently developed a full-stack web application using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Spring Boot, and MySQL that empowers users to manage their appointments seamlessly. Hereâ€™s what the app offers:

âœ… Key Features:

â€¢ Users can book, update, and delete appointments as per their requirements.
â€¢ Implemented OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) grant type for secure and seamless user authentication.
â€¢ Endpoints are safeguarded using Spring Security, offering robust protection for sensitive operations.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

â€¢ Frontend: Built with React.js for a dynamic and intuitive user experience, styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.
â€¢ Backend: Developed using Spring Boot, ensuring efficient business logic and RESTful API implementation and leveraging Hibernate for efficient ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to simplify interactions with the MySQL database. This combination ensures seamless data operations with minimal boilerplate code.
â€¢ Database: Leveraged MySQL to securely store and manage patient appointment details, ensuring high performance and reliability.
â€¢ Postman: Utilized for comprehensive API testing to ensure seamless backend functionality.

ðŸ”’ Security Highlights:

â€¢ Authentication is powered by OAuth 2.0 with PKCE grant type, integrating Keycloak for secure identity and session management.
â€¢ PKCE enhances the security of the authorization flow by mitigating interception risks during token exchange.
â€¢ Endpoints are fortified with Spring Security, ensuring data integrity and user privacy at every level.

ðŸ’¡ Spring Boot + Hibernate Integration:

The integration of Hibernate with Spring Boot has been a game-changer for database operations. By leveraging Hibernateâ€™s ORM capabilities, I was able to:
â€¢ Write efficient and concise queries.
â€¢ Map Java objects directly to database tables, reducing complexity.
â€¢ Simplify database interactions, enabling faster development cycles and cleaner code.

ðŸ’¡ Why PKCE?
The PKCE flow is particularly suited for public clients like single-page applications (SPAs), providing an extra layer of security by requiring a dynamically generated code verifier during token exchange.
This project has been an incredible journey of blending frontend innovation, backend precision, and security best practices to deliver a robust and user-friendly application.
